# PHY480-Computational-Physics
Directories are named based on the session as is to be expected. My responses to the questions will be saved as `Activities[n].md` within the appropriate directory (barring Session 1 where I hadn't realized I could do markdown, so it's just a `.txt` file).

Programs from class sessions that we're asked to expand on will be copied into a new `hw_[n]` directory for posterity and ease of grading.
